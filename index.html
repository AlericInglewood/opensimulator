        <h3>What is OpenSimulator?</h3>

OpenSimulator is an open source multi-platform, multi-user 3D application server. It can be used to create a virtual environment (or world) which can be accessed through a variety of clients, on multiple protocols. OpenSimulator allows virtual world developers to customize their worlds using the technologies they feel work best - we've designed the framework to be easily extensible. OpenSimulator is written in C#, running both on Windows over the .NET Framework and on Unix-like machines over the Mono framework. The source code is released under a BSD License, a commercially friendly license to embed OpenSimulator in products. If you want to know about our development history, see History.<br><br>

Out of the box, OpenSimulator can be used to simulate virtual environments similar to Second Life&#8482;, given that it supports the core of SL's messaging protocol. As such, these virtual worlds can be accessed with the regular SL viewers. However, OpenSimulator is neither a clone of Second Life's server nor does it aim at becoming such a clone. On the contrary, OpenSimulator lacks support for many of the game-specific features of Second Life (on purpose), while pursuing innovative directions towards becoming the bare bones, but extensible, server of the 3D Web.<br><br>

OpenSimulator is getting more stable as it approaches release 1.0, but we still consider it alpha software; so should you.<br><br>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Supports online, multi-user 3D environments as small as 1 simulator or 
	as large as thousands of simulators.</li>
	<li>Supports 3D virtual spaces of variable size within one single instance.</li>
	<li>Supports multiple clients and protocols - access the same world at the 
	same time via multiple protocols.</li>
	<li>Supports realtime Physics Simulation, with multiple engine options 
	including ODE.</li>
	<li>Supports clients that create 3D content in real time.</li>
	<li>Supports inworld scripting using a number of different languages, 
	including LSL/OSSL, C# and VB.NET</li>
	<li>Provides unlimited ability to customize virtual world applications 
	through the use of scene plugin modules.</li>
</ul>
